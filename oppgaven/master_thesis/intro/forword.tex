\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank all my friends who have supported me during the writing, and comforted me during the difficult times. A big thank you to Mahrin Tasfe, Emma Sofie Rikheim \& Celine Hagen, Vegard Eriksen Sæther, Emilie Risdal Danielsen, and Sindre Stokke for making sure I didn't overwork myself, and was able to get a breather during this intense period.

I would also like to give a big thank you to the Student Life Center in Ås and Ås Health Station for the help and the services they give to students which I was able to use. Mental health is health and it showed during the writing, and am eternally grateful for the free services they offer.

I would also like to thank my supervisors; Mareile Astrid Wolff, Berit Nordskog, and Brita Linnestad for taking me as their master student and being patient with me while I figured things out along the way this semester. You have been the best advisors I could get, and I thank you for your patience.
