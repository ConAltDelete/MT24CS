\subsection{Linear regression vs Plauborg}

The global measure for the linear regression has an average error of $2.3C^\circ \pm 4.23 C^\circ$ while the global messure of the Plauborg daily model has an average error of $0.6C^\circ \pm 1.96 C^\circ$. Further more Plauborg has an hight $R^2$ value indicating that it follows the temperature changes in the soil better than just scaling the air temperature by a scaling factor.

\subsection{Modification of Plauborg}

The Plauborg model as described in the article\cite{plauborg_simple_2002} shows similar results in Norway as in Denmark. With modification to the model to accept hourly data it still preforms as well as the daily data version.
