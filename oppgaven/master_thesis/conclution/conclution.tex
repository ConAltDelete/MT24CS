\subsection[Use of AI]{Use of Artificial Intelligence in this paper}

In this paper there has been used Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Bing Chat / Copilot hosted by Microsoft Cooperation with special agreement with \acrfull{ac:nmbu}, for the following purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Formalising sentences and rephrasing sentences.
	\item Spellchecking
	\item Code generation of basic consepts and structures (tree traversal, template for generic classes) 
\end{enumerate}

It is important to emphasize that our engagement with AI have been actively curated and verified with known information. All code underwent rigorous manual inspection within a dedicated testing environment. Furthermore, no confidential or sensitive information was shared with the AI; our interactions focused solely on broad topics and general inquiries. To validate the accuracy of AI-generated responses, we cross-referenced them with established research papers and textbooks.
