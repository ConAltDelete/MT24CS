\subsection{Future work}

The models chosen in this study is not a representative sample of current knowledge of soil temperature modelling, and this study did not aim for optimizing the models beyond what the original authors have already done with the exception for base models used for comparison puposus. A more comprehensive is needed of more complex models that utelises cutting edge technologies, techniques, and theory. One of which is logic based models, for instance ASPER\cite{le_asper_2023} that tries to incoerate logical descriptions of the problem and limits the model for better or equal results based on fewer samples\cite{machot_bridging_2023}. Another approch is to incorporate randomness into the deterministic models to explain the variation in the data, forinstance fractional Brownian motion\cite{di_crescenzo_model_2022}.
