	abstract = {Soil thermal diffusivity k is an essential parameter for studying surface and subsurface heat transfer and temperature changes. It is well understood that k mainly varies with soil texture, water content u, and bulk density rb, but few models are available to accurately quantify the relationship. In this study, an empirical model is developed for estimating k from soil particle size distribution, rb, and degree of water saturation Sr. The model parameters are determined by ﬁtting the proposed equations to heat-pulse k data for eight soils covering wide ranges of texture, rb, and Sr. Independent evaluations with published k data show that the new model describes the k(Sr) relationship accurately, with root-mean-square errors less than 0.75 3 1027 m2 s21. The proposed k(Sr) model also describes the responses of k to rb changes accurately in both laboratory and ﬁeld conditions. The new model is also used successfully for predicting near-surface soil temperature dynamics using the harmonic method. The results suggest that this model provides useful estimates of k from Sr, rb, and soil texture.},

	abstract = {Soil temperature (Ts) plays a key role in physical, biological and chemical processes in terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate estimation of Ts at various soil depths is crucial for land-atmosphere interactions. This study investigated the applicability of four different machine learning models, extreme learning machine ({ELM}), generalized regression neural networks ({GRNN}), backpropagation neural networks ({BPNN}) and random forests ({RF}), for modeling half-hourly Ts at four different depths of 2 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm on the Loess Plateau of China. A field experiment was conducted to measure half-hourly Ts and meteorological variables. Air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, solar radiation, and vapor pressure deficit were used as inputs to train the models for estimation of half-hourly Ts. The results showed {ELM}, {GRNN}, {BPNN} and {RF} models provided desirable performance in modeling half-hourly Ts at all depths, with root mean square error values ranging 2.26–2.95, 2.36–3.10, 2.32–3.04 and 2.31–3.00 °C, mean absolute error values ranging 1.76–2.26, 1.83–2.31, 1.80–2.32 and 1.79–2.26 °C, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient values ranging 0.856–0.930, 0.841–0.924, 0.847–0.927 and 0.850–0.927, and concordance correlation coefficient values ranging 0.925–0.965, 0.925–0.963, 0.928–0.963, and 0.924–0.961 for the {ELM}, {GRNN}, {BPNN}, and {RF} models, respectively. There was a statistically significant agreement (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) between the measured and modeled values at both half-hour and daily timescales, and the box plots showed the distributional differences between the measured and modeled values were small. Generally, the {ELM} model had slightly better performance with much better computation speed than {GRNN}, {BPNN} as well as {RF} models at half-hourly timescales, thus the {ELM} model was highly recommended to estimate Ts at different soil depths.},

	abstract = {Soil temperature ({ST}) plays a key role in the processes and functions of almost all ecosystems, and is also an essential parameter for various applications such as agricultural production, geothermal development, and their utilization. Although numerous machine learning models have been used in the prediction of {ST}, and good results have been obtained, most of the current studies have focused on daily or monthly {ST} predictions, while hourly {ST} predictions are scarce. This paper presents a novel scheme for forecasting the hourly {ST} using weather forecast data. The method considers the hourly {ST} prediction to be the superposition of two parts, namely, the daily average {ST} prediction and the {ST} amplitude (the diﬀerence between the hourly {ST} and the daily average {ST}) prediction. According to the results of correlation analysis, we selected nine meteorological parameters and combined two temporal parameters as the input vectors for predicting the daily average {ST}. For the task of predicting the {ST} amplitude, seven meteorological parameters and one temporal parameter were selected as the inputs. Two submodels were constructed using a deep bidirectional long short-term memory network ({BiLSTM}). For the task of hourly {ST} prediction at ﬁve diﬀerent soil depths at 30 sites, which are located in 5 common climates in the United States, the results showed the method proposed in this paper performs best at all depths for 30 stations (100\% of all) for the root mean square error ({RMSE}), 27 stations (90\% of all) for the mean absolute error ({MAE}), and 30 stations (100\% of all) for the coeﬃcient of determination (R2), respectively. Moreover, the method adopted in this study displays a stronger {ST} prediction ability than the traditional methods under all climate types involved in the experiment, the hourly {ST} produced by it can be used as a driving parameter for high-resolution biogeochemical models, land surface models and hydrological models and can provide ideas for an analysis of other time series data.},

The global model is based on 10 years data from 13 meteorological stations at different soils in Denmark. The root mean square error of the model was 0.97 °C, and 98\% of the variation in data was explained. The model was not improved by inclusion of the discrete factors, soils or stations.

	abstract = {Microbial processes in soil are moisture, nutrient and temperature dependent and, consequently, accurate calculation of soil temperature is important for modelling nitrogen processes. Microbial activity in soil occurs even at sub-zero temperatures so that, in northern latitudes, a method to calculate soil temperature under snow cover and in frozen soils is required. This paper describes a new and simple model to calculate daily values for soil temperature at various depths in both frozen and unfrozen soils. The model requires four parameters: average soil thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity of soil, specific heat capacity due to freezing and thawing and an empirical snow parameter. Precipitation, air temperature and snow depth (measured or calculated) are needed as input variables. The proposed model was applied to five sites in different parts of Finland representing different climates and soil types. Observed soil temperatures at depths of 20 and 50 cm (September 1981August 1990) were used for model calibration. The calibrated model was then tested using observed soil temperatures from September 1990 to August 2001. R2-values of the calibration period varied between 0.87 and 0.96 at a depth of 20 cm and between 0.78 and 0.97 at 50 cm. R2-values of the testing period were between 0.87 and 0.94 at a depth of 20cm, and between 0.80 and 0.98 at 50cm. Thus, despite the simplifications made, the model was able to simulate soil temperature at these study sites. This simple model simulates soil temperature well in the uppermost soil layers where most of the nitrogen processes occur. The small number of parameters required means that the model is suitable for addition to catchment scale models.},

	abstract = {A common way to form scores from multiple-item scales is to sum responses of all items. Though sum scoring is often contrasted with factor analysis as a competing method, we review how factor analysis and sum scoring both fall under the larger umbrella of latent variable models, with sum scoring being a constrained version of a factor analysis. Despite similarities, reporting of psychometric properties for sum scored or factor analyzed scales are quite different. Further, if researchers use factor analysis to validate a scale but subsequently sum score the scale, this employs a model that differs from validation model. By framing sum scoring within a latent variable framework, our goal is to raise awareness that (a) sum scoring requires rather strict constraints, (b) imposing these constraints requires the same type of justification as any other latent variable model, and (c) sum scoring corresponds to a statistical model and is not a model-free arithmetic calculation. We discuss how unjustified sum scoring can have adverse effects on validity, reliability, and qualitative classification from sum score cut-offs. We also discuss considerations for how to use scale scores in subsequent analyses and how these choices can alter conclusions. The general goal is to encourage researchers to more critically evaluate how they obtain, justify, and use multiple-item scale scores.},

	abstract = {Validation of models for plant disease management is a crucial part in the development of decision support systems in plant protection. Bespoke field trials are usually conducted to determine the performance of a model under practical conditions. However, field trials are very resource-demanding, and the use of already existing field trial data could significantly reduce costs for model validation. In this study, we took this novel approach to verify the performance of models for determining the need of fungicide applications against leaf blotch diseases in wheat by utilising historical weather data and yield data available from fungicide efficacy field trials. Two models based on humidity factors were used in the study. To estimate how specific humidity settings in the two models affect the number of recommended fungicide treatments per season, historical weather data from a 5year period from weather stations in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Lithuania was used. The model output shows major differences between seasons and regions, typically recommending between one and three treatments per season. To determine the prediction potential of the models, data on yield gains from either one or two fungicide applications in fungicide efficacy trials conducted in wheat over a 5-year period in the five countries was utilised. The yield responses from fungicide treatments in the efficacy trials varied considerably between years and countries, as did the proportion of predictions of profitable treatments. In general, there was a tendency for the models to overestimate the need to apply fungicides (low specificity), but they rarely failed to recommend an application that was needed (high sensitivity). Despite the importance of having specific trials across regions in order to adjust models to local cropping and weather conditions, our study shows that historical weather data and existing field trial data have the potential to be used in model validation.},

Soil temperatures are usually estimated with various models including the artificial neural networks ({ANNs}), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system ({ANFIS}), and multiple linear regression ({MLR}) models. Soil temperatures along with other climate data are recorded by the Turkish State Meteorological Service ({MGM}) at specific locations all over Turkey. Soil temperatures are commonly measured at 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-cm depths below the soil surface. In this study, the soil temperature data in monthly units measured at 261 stations in Turkey having records of at least 20 years were used to develop relevant models. Different input combinations were tested in the {ANN} and {ANFIS} models to estimate soil temperatures, and the best combination of significant explanatory variables turns out to be monthly minimum and maximum air temperatures, calendar month number, depth of soil, and monthly precipitation. Next, three standard error terms (mean absolute error ({MAE}, °C), root mean squared error ({RMSE}, °C), and determination coefficient (R2)) were employed to check the reliability of the test data results obtained through the {ANN}, {ANFIS}, and {MLR} models. {ANFIS} ({RMSE} 1.99; {MAE} 1.09; R2 0.98) is found to outperform both {ANN} and {MLR} ({RMSE} 5.80, 8.89; {MAE} 1.89, 2.36; R2 0.93, 0.91) in estimating soil temperature in Turkey.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of soil moisture ({SM}) and soil temperature ({ST}) plays an important role in Earth system science, helping to forecast and understand ecosystem changes. They present great challenges because landatmospheric interactions are complex and diverse in space and time. Although deep learning methods have excellent performance for land surface variables’ prediction such as {SM} and {ST}, they are often questioned due to their over-parameterized black-box nature and neglect of physical knowledge and interpretability. From this, we propose an attention-aware {LSTM} Model ({ILSTM}\_Soil) by taking multi-feature attention, predictor attention and temporal attention into account. We first used {LSTM} to generate multi-feature vectors of all predictors, and then the three attention mechanisms were designed to summarize these feature vectors for {SM} and {ST} prediction. Experiment results for {SM} and {ST} prediction at the lead time of 1 and 7 days on ten {FLUXNET} sites suggest that the proposed {ILSTM}\_Soil model outperforms Random Forest ({RF}), Support Vector Regression ({SVR}), Elastic-Net ({ENET}), original Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}), and attention {LSTM} (A-{LSTM}) models in most cases. The interpretation of attention weights verifies that the proposed model can capture physical knowledge over {SM} and {ST}. The code of {ILSTM}\_Soil is made publicly available and we hope it can encourage researchers to develop effective {DL} models in land surface variables’ prediction conveniently.},

Advances in environmental and plant measurement equipment provide the opportunity for more data to be collected from plant growing operations, which could result in more accurate predictions. The objective of this study was to predict the strawberry growth and fruit yield using environmental and growth data collected with this equipment. The correlation coefficients of the average daily air temperature and soil temperature data for strawberry growth predictions were higher than the relative humidity, soil moisture content, electronic conductivity, {CO}2 concentration, photosynthetic active radiation, and vapor pressure deficit data. The correlation coefficients of photosynthetic active radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and relative humidity for strawberry yield prediction were higher than the other environmental data and all growth data such as plant height, crown diameter, and leaf length and width. The regression model using environmental data showed high correlation coefficients with the actual yield data (R2 = 0.99). These results indicate that strawberry growth and fruit yield could be predicted using environmental data.},

We brie y review Hochreiter's 1991 analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, e cient, gradient-based method called {\textbackslash}Long Short-Term Memory" ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete time steps by enforcing constant error ow through {\textbackslash}constant error carrousels" within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error ow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with arti cial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with {RTRL}, {BPTT}, Recurrent Cascade-Correlation, Elman nets, and Neural Sequence Chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, arti cial long time lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

The Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the forward and backward passes of backpropagation by two forward passes, one with positive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data which could be generated by the network itself. Each layer has its own objective function which is simply to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for negative data. The sum of the squared activities in a layer can be used as the goodness but there are many other possibilities, including minus the sum of the squared activities. If the positive and negative passes could be separated in time, the negative passes could be done ofﬂine, which would make the learning much simpler in the positive pass and allow video to be pipelined through the network without ever storing activities or stopping to propagate derivatives.},

However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often replaced by practitioners in favour of an out-of-sample ({OOS}) evaluation. It is shown that for purely autoregressive models, the use of standard K -fold {CV} is possible provided the models considered have uncorrelated errors. Such a setup occurs, for example, when the models nest a more appropriate model. This is very common when Machine Learning methods are used for prediction, and where {CV} can control for overfitting the data. Theoretical insights supporting these arguments are presented, along with a simulation study and a real-world example. It is shown empirically that K -fold {CV} performs favourably compared to both {OOS} evaluation and other timeseries-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation.},

National policy formulation and strategic planning requires long-term forecasts at an aggregate level, while regional operational decisions require short-term forecasts, relevant to local tourism operators. For aligned decisions at all levels, supporting forecasts must be ‘coherent’, that is they should add up appropriately, across relevant demarcations (e.g., geographical divisions or market segments) and also across time. We propose an approach for generating coherent forecasts across both cross-sections and planning horizons for Australia. This results in signiﬁcant improvements in forecast accuracy with substantial decision making beneﬁts. Coherent forecasts help break intra- and inter-organisational information and planning silos, in a data driven fashion, blending information from diﬀerent sources.},

Each strategy is analyzed in terms of forecast accuracy and computational time. Apart from the modeling decisions, any successful time series forecasting methodology has to be able to capture the seasonal and trend patterns found in a time series. In this regard, some clever techniques to cope with these patterns are also suggested. The proposed methodology is able to forecast time series in an automatic way.

This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of a land surface model (Noah Multiparameterization (Noah-{MP})) against a traditional crop model (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate Model ({EPIC})) in estimating soil temperature. A sets of soil temperature estimates, including three different {EPIC} simulations (i.e., using different parameterizations) and a Noah-{MP} simulations, is compared to ground-based measurements from across the Central Valley in California, {USA}, during 2000–2019. The main conclusion is that relying only on one set of model estimates may not be optimal. Furthermore, by combining different model simulations, i.e., by taking the mean of two model simulations to reconstruct a new set of soil temperature estimates, it is possible to improve the performance of the single model in terms of different statistical metrics against the reference ground observations. Containing ratio ({CR}), Euclidean distance (dist), and correlation co-efﬁcient (R) calculated for the reconstructed mean improved by 52\%, 58\%, and 10\%, respectively, compared to both model estimates. Thus, the reconstructed mean estimates are shown to be more capable of capturing soil temperature variations under different soil characteristics and across different geographical conditions when compared to the parent model simulations.},

In this work, we provide fundamental principles for interpretable {ML}, and dispel common misunderstandings that dilute the importance of this crucial topic. We also identify 10 technical challenge areas in interpretable machine learning and provide history and background on each problem. Some of these problems are classically important, and some are recent problems that have arisen in the last few years. These problems are: (1) Optimizing sparse logical models such as decision trees; (2) Optimization of scoring systems; (3) Placing constraints into generalized additive models to encourage sparsity and better interpretability; (4) Modern case-based reasoning, including neural networks and matching for causal inference; (5) Complete supervised disentanglement of neural networks; (6) Complete or even partial unsupervised disentanglement of neural networks; (7) Dimensionality reduction for data visualization; (8) Machine learning models that can incorporate physics and other generative or causal constraints; (9) Characterization of the "Rashomon set" of good models; and (10) Interpretable reinforcement learning. This survey is suitable as a starting point for statisticians and computer scientists interested in working in interpretable machine learning.},

	abstract = {The success of the Lasso in the era of high-dimensional data can be attributed to its conducting an implicit model selection, i.e., zeroing out regression coefficients that are not significant. By contrast, classical ridge regression can not reveal a potential sparsity of parameters, and may also introduce a large bias under the high-dimensional setting. Nevertheless, recent work on the Lasso involves debiasing and thresholding, the latter in order to further enhance the model selection. As a consequence, ridge regression may be worth another look since -- after debiasing and thresholding -- it may offer some advantages over the Lasso, e.g., it can be easily computed using a closed-form expression. \% and it has similar performance to threshold Lasso. In this paper, we define a debiased and thresholded ridge regression method, and prove a consistency result and a Gaussian approximation theorem. We further introduce a wild bootstrap algorithm to construct confidence regions and perform hypothesis testing for a linear combination of parameters. In addition to estimation, we consider the problem of prediction, and present a novel, hybrid bootstrap algorithm tailored for prediction intervals. Extensive numerical simulations further show that the debiased and thresholded ridge regression has favorable finite sample performance and may be preferable in some settings.},

              Soil temperature is a key control on belowground chemical and biological processes. Typically, models of soil temperature are developed and validated for large geographic regions. However, modeling frameworks intended for higher spatial resolutions (much finer than 1 km
              2
              ) are lacking across areas of complex topography. Here we propose a simple modeling framework for predicting distributed soil temperature at high temporal (i.e., 1 h steps) and spatial (i.e., 5 × 5 m) resolutions in mountainous terrain, based on a few discrete air temperature measurements. In this context, two steps were necessary to estimate the soil temperature. First, we applied the potential temperature equation to generate the air temperature distribution from a 5 m digital elevation model and Inverse Distance Weighting interpolation. Second, we applied a hybrid model to estimate the distribution of soil temperature based on the generated air temperature surfaces. Our results show that this approach simulated the spatial distribution of soil temperature well, with a root‐mean‐square error ranging from {\textasciitilde}2.1 to 2.9°C. Furthermore, our approach predicted the daily and monthly variability of soil temperature well. The proposed framework can be applied to estimate the spatial variability of soil temperature in mountainous regions where direct observations are scarce.

	abstract = {Soil temperature (Ts), a key variable in geosciences study, has generated growing interest among researchers. There are many factors affecting the spatiotemporal variation of Ts, which poses immense challenges for the Ts estimation. To enrich processing information on loss function and achieve better performance in estimation, the paper designed a new long short-term memory model using quadruplet loss function as an intelligence tool for data processing ({QL}-{LSTM}). The model in this paper combined the traditional squared-error loss function with distance metric learning between the sample features. It can zoom analyze the samples accurately to optimize the estimation accuracy. We applied the meteorological data from Laegern and Fluehli stations at 5, 10, and 15 cm depth on the 1st, 5th, and 15th day separately to verify the performance of the proposed soil temperature estimation model. Meanwhile, this paper inputs the variables into the proposed model including radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, wind speed, air pressure, and past Ts data. The performance of the model was tested by several error evaluation indices, including root mean square error ({RMSE}), mean absolute error ({MAE}), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ({NS}), Willmott Index of Agreement ({WI}), and Legates and {McCabe} index ({LMI}). As the test results at different soil depths show, our model generally outperformed the four existing advanced estimation models, namely, backpropagation neural networks, extreme learning machines, support vector regression, and {LSTM}. Furthermore, as experiments show, the proposed model achieved the best performance at the 15 cm depth of soil on the 1st day at Laegern station, which achieved higher {WI} (0.998), {NS} (0.995), and {LMI} (0.938) values, and got lower {RMSE} (0.312) and {MAE} (0.239) values. Consequently, the {QL}-{LSTM} model is recommended to estimate daily Ts profiles estimation on the 1st, 5th, and 15th days.},

	abstract = {We present a reinforcement learning framework, called Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning ({PIRL}), that is designed to generate interpretable and verifiable agent policies. Unlike the popular Deep Reinforcement Learning ({DRL}) paradigm, which represents policies by neural networks, {PIRL} represents policies using a high-level, domain-specific programming language. Such programmatic policies have the benefits of being more easily interpreted than neural networks, and being amenable to verification by symbolic methods. We propose a new method, called Neurally Directed Program Search ({NDPS}), for solving the challenging nonsmooth optimization problem of finding a programmatic policy with maximal reward. {NDPS} works by first learning a neural policy network using {DRL}, and then performing a local search over programmatic policies that seeks to minimize a distance from this neural "oracle". We evaluate {NDPS} on the task of learning to drive a simulated car in the {TORCS} car-racing environment. We demonstrate that {NDPS} is able to discover human-readable policies that pass some significant performance bars. We also show that {PIRL} policies can have smoother trajectories, and can be more easily transferred to environments not encountered during training, than corresponding policies discovered by {DRL}.},

Variable selection is carried out using simple existing techniques. The problem of selecting the number of hidden units is solved by sequentially applying Lagrange multiplier type tests, with the aim of avoiding the estimation of unidentiﬁed models. Misspeciﬁcation tests are derived for evaluating an estimated neural network model. All the tests are entirely based on auxiliary regressions and are easily implemented. A smallsample simulation experiment is carried out to show how the proposed modelling strategy works and how the misspeciﬁcation tests behave in small samples. Two applications to real time series, one univariate and the other multivariate, are considered as well. Sets of one-step-ahead forecasts are constructed and forecast accuracy is compared with that of other nonlinear models applied to the same series. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, despite all advantages cited for artiﬁcial neural networks, their performance for some real time series is not satisfactory. Improving forecasting especially time series forecasting accuracy is an important yet often difﬁcult task facing forecasters. Both theoretical and empirical ﬁndings have indicated that integration of different models can be an effective way of improving upon their predictive performance, especially when the models in the ensemble are quite different. In this paper, a novel hybrid model of artiﬁcial neural networks is proposed using auto-regressive integrated moving average ({ARIMA}) models in order to yield a more accurate forecasting model than artiﬁcial neural networks. The empirical results with three well-known real data sets indicate that the proposed model can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy achieved by artiﬁcial neural networks.
